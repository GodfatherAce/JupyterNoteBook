    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive statistics: usually summarizes data from a sample using measures such as the mean or standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential statistics: which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).\n",

    "Descriptive statistics are are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution of data, central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other.\n"
